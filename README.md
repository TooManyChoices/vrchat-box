# vrchatbox
simple program to send unix stdin or operands as vrchat chatbox input.
## building
1. clone this repo `git clone this-repo`
2. cargo build `cargo build`
3. profit `vrchatbox`
### (installing)
1. `cargo install --path .`
2. now u can use anywhere as the current user
## how to use
do `vrchat -h` for all flags you can use
you can use this in bash/zsh/whatever scripts to chatbox abuse because you're just sooo cool and above whatever other people (the people you are talking to/are trying to talk to you) feel about it.

as an example, here's a sh script i made to show my content cache size whenever it changes, clearing it after a measly 5 seconds too.
```sh
CONTENT_CACHE="/tmp/VRCCache" # don't ask why it's in tmp :3
if [ ! -d "$CONTENT_CACHE" ]; then
	echo nothing at "$CONTENT_CACHE" stopping
	exit
fi

PREV_SIZE=$(du -hs "$CONTENT_CACHE" | awk '{print $1}')
while true; do
	if [ ! -d "$CONTENT_CACHE" ]; then
		echo nothing at "$CONTENT_CACHE" stopping
		exit
	fi
	SIZE=$(du -hs "$CONTENT_CACHE" | awk '{print $1}')
	if [[ "$PREV_SIZE" != "$SIZE" ]] then
		echo "my cache rn: $(echo $PREV_SIZE)b > $(echo $SIZE)b" | vrchatbox
		PREV_SIZE=$SIZE
	fi
	sleep 5
	echo "" | vrchatbox
done
```
### but what if i'm a windows user, which is literally the only platform vrchat supports
uhhhh

maybe i'll make a gui one day idk
there's also using operands instead, `vrchat -- {whatever chatbox input}`
