# vrchatbox
simple osc client to send stdin/operands to vrchat as chatbox input.
## building
1. clone this repo `git clone this-repo`
2. cargo build `cargo build`
3. profit `vrchatbox`
### (installing)
1. `cargo install --path .`
2. now u can use anywhere as the current user
## how to use
run `vrchatbox -h`

small examples:
- `fortune | vrchatbox`
- `playerctl metadata title | vrchatbox`

you can also use this in sh scripts to chatbox abuse with ultimate configuration, i guess.

as an example, here's a sh script i made to show my content cache size whenever it changes, clearing it after a measly 5 seconds too.
```sh
CONTENT_CACHE="path_to_your_content_cache"
if [ ! -d "$CONTENT_CACHE" ]; then
	echo nothing at "$CONTENT_CACHE" stopping
	exit
fi

PREV_SIZE=$(du -hs "$CONTENT_CACHE" | awk '{print $1}')
while true; do
	if [ ! -d "$CONTENT_CACHE" ]; then
		echo nothing at "$CONTENT_CACHE" stopping
		exit
	fi
	SIZE=$(du -hs "$CONTENT_CACHE" | awk '{print $1}')
	if [[ "$PREV_SIZE" != "$SIZE" ]] then
		echo "my cache rn: $(echo $PREV_SIZE)b > $(echo $SIZE)b" | vrchatbox
		PREV_SIZE=$SIZE
	fi
	sleep 5
	echo "" | vrchatbox
done
```
## how to get it atleast working on every platform vrchat actually supports (except for ios)
### android
first you'll need [termux](https://termux.dev/) which is a terminal/shell/package manager without needing to root your device.

in termux, setup your package repository mirrors with `termux-change-repo` and run `pkg install git rust` to install git and rust to your device.

clone this repo by running `git clone github.com/TooManyChoices/vrchatbox` and go into it with `cd vrchatbox`

finally you can run `cargo build --release` and a binary should be made as `target/release/vrchatbox`

you could instead run `cargo install --path .` to have the binary go into a directory that any cargo thing you install goes to, but then you'd have to add that directoy to your $PATH to run it and that's out of the scope of this README.md.

good luck writing a bash script on mobile ;-;

### quest/pico vr headsets
it's actually the same process as on android, because they are just android, but you need developer mode on quest to install termux, and idk about pico.

### windows
i haven't tried this, but i'm assuming it'll work. to get stdin on windows you could probably use [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) as it has a bash shell. you could also try the windows subsystem on linux, if osc even works through that.

## plans
- have a gui app (with android support)
- something else i forgot
