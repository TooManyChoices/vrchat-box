## *formerly.. vrchatbox*

*gui app coming in 2050*

`vrchat-box` is a simple cli tool that sends data to VRChat's OSC port at /chatbox/input, enabling you to say anything a linux command can output (that is less than 144 characters and is properly formatted text) 

## TO USE
`vrchat-box --help` shows the few options you have regarding configuration:
```
--help: show this message
--version: show a different message
--client-port: set port of osc client, or OS will choose randomly
--server-address: set address of vrchat osc server, or default to ({VRCHAT_OSC_ADDR})
--enable-sfx: every message sent makes the chatbox notification sound, probably don't enable
--show-keyboard: instead of instantly becoming a message, outputs it to client keyboard
--append-mode: if taking from stdin, add onto a growing buffer of a message instead of completely replacing the previous messages
--typing-indicator: enable in-game typing indicator for lifetime of this program
```

You may pipe text from another program into `vrchat-box` by running it as ``echo "savhjkerfbkhea" | vrchat-box`` or having anything after a "--" will send that instead, example: ``vrchat-box -- savhjkerfbkhea``

The intended use case is in sh scripts, which is like running the command normally but in a text file.

## TO INSTALL

### linux

You need to have rust/cargo installed on your system. Should be easy enough. Right.

Run ``cargo install --git "https://github.com/TooManyChoices/vrchat-box.git"`` which will place a compiled binary in ~/.cargo/bin/ which you may add to your $PATH.

To update, you just run that command again whenever you feel that there's been an update.

### android

You CAN build and run this on an android device, like a phone or a ~~meta~~ oculus quest. I just don't know enough about android to give proper instructions.

If you don't already have a terminal shell on your device, install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/), and in it run ``pkg install rust``

Follow the linux instructions, the directory that the binary goes will probably be different though.

### windows

So the regular Windows shell doesn't support the one thing that makes this program any useful, so you're gonna need to install [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) first.

Then run ``cargo install --git "https://github.com/TooManyChoices/vrchat-box.git"`` and the binary should be built and put... somewhere man idk.
